​​Figma is a design tool similar to Sketch, that runs on web. Using their API, you can export a design as JSON and also export images from specific layers. The assignment is to build a web app using React with Typescript, that uses this API to display a screen from a Figma file.
​​
​​Users should be able to select layers on this screen by clicking on them, which displays the layer’s name and coordinates on the right panel. Also, we want to give special attention to 2 types of layers.
​​If the layer is a text layer, we want to display some text properties on the right panel.
​​If the layer is exportable (see Notes for details), we also want to display 2 sizes of assets (1x and 2x) on the right panel. Image formats will be PNG.
